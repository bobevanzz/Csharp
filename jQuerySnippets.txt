hey there everyone, I found a package of jQuery snippets to make life easier in Sublime Text, for now lol.
to install packages  First open up a file explorer and locate your User folder, which is where we will be placing the jQuery-master snippet folder.
Here's an example of where you'd find it:C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User. Keep in mind AppData is a hidden folder so you'll need to have hidden items enabled. Once you located it,open up a browser and paste https://github.com/SublimeText/jQuery. Once you're here and you're logged into your github account, on the right side you'll see a Clone or Download button. click it and then select Download ZIP. once you download the zip, open it up and extract everything into the same location you initially downloaded or where your prefer. Once everything is extracted, right click the folder and copy it. Now go back to your file explorer, if you found the User folder from earlier you need to paste the extracted jQuery-master into it. here's mine to show as an example C:\Users\bedro\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User\jQuery-master. Now once you think you're good to go, restart sublime and you're good to go! mess around with the snippets by going into one of our jquery.html's from today and inside the script function put a $().click and press the tab. this is merely one example but i'm sure it'll make life easier in the long run. I'm looking into finding ones for c# and maybe javascript as well
