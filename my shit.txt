I asked Kim if I was going to get any of the course material this time around since the only one I was present at was the dispensing of the SQL server packet back in November. I normally like to listen and pay attention instead of taking notes of all the slides and since i already paid for them, i'd like them if possible lol. I still haven't received my book either so if there's any issue, keep the book and ill take the packets and booklets, I already found an online pdf of the book anyways. Youre the best!
